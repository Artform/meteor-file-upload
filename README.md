# fileUpload Example
This demo uses components from https://github.com/tomitrescak/meteor-uploads

## Required Packages:

> https://atmospherejs.com/tomi/upload-server
> https://atmospherejs.com/tomi/upload-jquery

`$ meteor add tomi:upload-server tomi:upload-jquery`

## Notes:
*  Default upload location is `/Uploads`. It will be created automagically for you when you launch your project and upload. I've omitted it from the repo.
*  This fork is based on https://github.com/wesyah234/fileUploadDemo2
